# ScholarMode
YouTube redesigned for learning!
We've created a chrome-extension that provides a way to map out your learning through projects. 
Our new update brings voted tags into YouTube to change the way we choose videos.

## Steps to build and Load extension
1. run `yarn install` //installs dependencies
2. run `yarn build:extension` //compiles react into production-ready code
3. open chrome://extensions/
4. load unpacked >> choose the build folder (generated by step 1)
5. Open YouTube and try it out

## To test any changes (Just for the devs)
1. save all changes and run `yarn build:extension`
2. reload extension from chrome://extensions/ and start testing
